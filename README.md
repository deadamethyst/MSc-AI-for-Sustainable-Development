# MSc AI for Sustainable Development

**Coursework and research artifacts applying AI to sustainable development, climate applications, and AI governance.**

This repository documents hands-on labs, assignments, and selected research projects completed as part of my MSc in Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on three key areas:

- **Deep Learning** – Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and model experimentation.  
- **Applied AI** – Practical AI solutions for real-world problems, including climate, energy, and urban sustainability.  
- **Responsible, Transparent, and Accountable AI (RTAI)** – Fairness, explainability, auditing, and governance-aware AI practices.

## How to Navigate

- Each module folder contains lab folders with:
  - Clean code and notebooks
  - Short README explaining objectives, methods, and key findings
  - Optional reports or visualizations (where allowed)
- Datasets are included only if permitted; otherwise, instructions to obtain them are provided.
- Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` for each lab.

---

## Highlights

- **Deep Learning:** CNNs for image classification, RNNs for sequence modeling, transformer experimentation.  
- **Applied AI:** Climate prediction models, energy optimization simulations, urban heat island analysis.  
- **Responsible AI:** Fairness and bias analysis, model explainability, AI auditing, and governance-focused experiments.  
- **Research Projects:** Extended work beyond coursework, exploring agentic behavior under model compression and policy-aware AI frameworks.

---

## Notes

- All work was completed as part of MSc AI coursework, emphasizing **independent implementation, experimentation, and critical analysis**.  
- Selected research projects extend lab work with additional experiments and insights.  
- Please **cite appropriately** if referencing this repository or any contained work.
